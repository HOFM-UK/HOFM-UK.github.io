									Often times, when one goes to a Christian conference, they tend to receive from God; something that the Lord has been wanting to give them. And receive we did, but it was a lot more than that for a few of the YOTN (Youth on the Narrow) members that embarked on this life altering trip to Orlando. Already, I see an eyebrow raised and I completely understand. As a matter of fact, I don’t blame you in the slightest. For JESUS 18, was a moment in which our lives were marked and changed forever. Not only did we receive so much from the Lord in the space of one week, but we were also privileged to be emptied of ourselves in order for God to give to others through us.
								</p>

								<p>
									Essentially, what I am trying to say about JESUS 18 is that there is too much to say. But in this short amount of time we have, I shall attempt to make it brief.
								</p>

								<p>
									Much was to be expected from our trip to Orlando, but never in the way that we could have imagined. A lot of planning, preparation and thought had gone into the journey. Even on a 9-hour flight to get there, our stomachs clenched in anticipation and excitement for what God was going to do in this well renowned conference that we had heard so much about every year but had never had the opportunity to go. For now, was the time. The moment. That our hearts would be purified, and we would be marked with a true passion to seek the face of the Lord.
								</p>

								<p>
									The first night of the conference set precedent. It allowed us to understand that this would be an experience like none other. With the presence of God so thick and tangible in the atmosphere, and bodies littering the ground after being slain by the Holy Ghost, we knew that God was coming for us in a new way.
								</p>

								<p>
									Every night thereafter, got better and better. God began to break down our walls. Each of us encountered God in ways that we would never forget. Each day, we received from God only to pour out into others around us and it was amazing to see God completely “wreck us” (some new terminology we learnt while in the USA) and use us in the way He did. We met amazing people that we will also never forget, friends for life that God brought to us specifically. More than anything, we were baptized in His Holy Fire and with His Spirit. In fact, the most powerful encounters we experienced, were the ones back in the house that we were staying. I believe strongly that God was humbling us, inviting us to remove our eyes from the ‘man’ and fix our gaze on the Son of Man, Jesus Christ.
								</p>

								<p>
									So much was learnt in Orlando 18, and God’s call upon each individual’s life became clearer. Most interestingly, as we have become accustomed to seeing, is the way God moved in our private lives post-Orlando. When we got back to London, we brought the fire of the Lord with us, and from that moment we understood that God was not done with us yet. Again, He was teaching us that His Presence was not restricted to conferences alone. The fire for God and His love begins in the home, and we learnt this truth very swiftly. We grew an appetite for His Presence and whenever we gathered, it ended in a time of prayer and worship and seeing God’s miraculous hand even in our own homes.
								</p>

								<p>
									All in all, Jesus 18 changed us forever. From that journey, we cultivated a new ethos. That everything we did, and still do today, must have Jesus at the centre and at the forefront. Jesus must be everything.
								</p>

								<p>
									Until next time.
								</p>

										Don’t get familiar with how He comes.
									</strong> 
								</p>

								<p>
									One of the recurring themes of our first ever church retreat was this one key phrase. A lot of the time, we as Christians tend to hit a brick wall in our pursuit for more of the Lord. We feel as if the things we were doing before to get close to Him, no longer seem to be doing the trick and we become frustrated and perhaps even angry. But with that being said, if there is anything that I personally took home from last summer’s retreat, was to expect the unexpected. God never shows up in the same way every time, and sometimes it is a lesson we ought to learn. We cannot put God in a box or limit what He can do, because He is God and we are but dust and clay.
								</p>

								<p>
									Embarking on this journey to Ashburnham amongst my brothers and sisters was truly a life changing experience. None of us knew exactly what to expect, but we were expectant none the less. We had been in and out of dialogue for months, about how desperately we needed just a day or two, away from the noise and busyness of life, and to simply linger in the sweet and blissful presence of the Lord. Boy, did we get that and much more!
								</p>

								<p>
									Much was learnt there in Ashburnham, with unique encounters from God in each of our lives and a fresh infilling of unspeakable joy. You can imagine what it must have looked like. Waking up early, day and night, to simply rest in the presence of God and to worship and praise Him with a complete abandonment, and disregard for time might I add. We became so hungry and set ablaze with a new fire for the Lord, that even on our breaks, many of us youths would gather together in different rooms and invite the Lord into the room. We became addicted. Truly, looking back I can say with ease, that the retreat increased our spiritual stamina, but also provoked us to reflect on how we have been seeking the Lord. None left the same way that we came. 
								</p>

								<p>
									A lot happened in those few days we stayed, and all in all it was a time to remember. I encourage every single person to get away, whether that be by yourself, with family, friends or your whole church, and be with God, give Him your undivided attention, because it will change your life forever. The way you seek Him individually and even corporately will be altered. He will see your heart; your hunger and He will show up. All we have to do is come with open minds, without any preconceptions of exactly how He wants to come in and we will find Him. 
								</p>

									God bless xoxo

									<strong>
										Praying for Ministries, Missionaries, Missions, and Churches, those who call on the name of God in Spirit and Truth, for HOF COT to experience supernatural increase, ministry gifts and talents to break forth, Spiritual growth, favour and revival.

								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									We are labourers together with God. We work in conjunction with the Holy Spirit and being in ministry is a divine calling. God called us and gave us ministries and what it becomes is determined by us. 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									<i>
										"I planted, Apollos watered, but God made it grow. Because of this, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but the only one who is anything is God who makes it grow. The one who plants and the one who waters work together, but each one will receive their own reward for their own labor." - 1 Corinthians 3:6-8 CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog"> 
									My Father and my God, help me to create an atmosphere of increase in the ministry you have called me to. Let me work in conjunction with the Holy Spirit, as you have called me, equip me, let me not work in vain, let me learn to work with the Holy Spirit. Father you qualify the unqualified, whatever we need to grow your church, Father make provision.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									We must evangelise to our children as we grow and pull them along. If we neglect our children, we stand the risk of losing them. Being in a mission is not a personal inheritance; we have to pass it along to our young people and children. 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									<i> 
										"So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, 'Go! Worship the Lord your God! But who exactly is going with you?' Moses said, 'We’ll go with our young and old, with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because we all must observe the Lord’s festival.' Pharaoh said to them, 'Yes, the Lord will be with you, all right, especially if I let your children go with you! Obviously, you are plotting some evil scheme.'" - Exodus 10:8-10 CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									Father in my mission, let me not be content with half measures, let me take back everything you have given to me to complete my mission. We and our children will get to the Promised Land. We will not be deceived with false generosity.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									There are various ministering gifts in the Bible. Ephesians 4 identified 5 fold ministries (Pastors, Apostles, Evangelist, Teachers and Prophets). Nonetheless, Romans 12 points out that we have different gifts that are consistent with God’s grace that has been given to us. 
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									<i>
										"He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers. His purpose was to equip God’s people for the work of serving and building up the body of Christ until we all reach the unity of faith and knowledge of God’s Son. God’s goal is for us to become mature adults—to be fully grown, measured by the standard of the fullness of Christ. As a result, we aren’t supposed to be infants any longer who can be tossed and blown around by every wind that comes from teaching with deceitful scheming and the tricks people play to deliberately mislead others. Instead, by speaking the truth with love, let’s grow in every way into Christ," - Ephesians 4:11-15 CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									<i>
										"We have different gifts that are consistent with God’s grace that has been given to us. If your gift is prophecy, you should prophesy in proportion to your faith. If your gift is service, devote yourself to serving. If your gift is teaching, devote yourself to teaching. If your gift is encouragement, devote yourself to encouraging. The one giving should do it with no strings attached. The leader should lead with passion. The one showing mercy should be cheerful." - Romans 12:6-8 CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									Father, let your gifts in the HOF COT continue to manifest every second, minute, hour and day. Let me recognise the gift you have placed inside of me. The boldness to step out father and stir up the gifts in me, release unto me and the church. Let me not  covert another person’s gift instead let me pray for the manifestations of diverse gifts in your church.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									The church is you and I. Let us pray to grow, develop and be who God wants us to be in both our personal and professional lives and also for those that God has called out.

									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									HOF COT will flourish; none of us will hinder the increase of the work of God in the church. Anything in me, that will hinder the  growth of the church ie anger, malice, backbiting, poison of the tongue, Holy Spirit cleanse me from the inside out and help me to be  a vessel fit for the master’s use.

									In building a home, you need experts in various areas, carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers etc. The church of God needs to be built to specification.

									<i>
										"He set up lamps in the Lord’s presence, just as the Lord had commended Moses. He put the Gold altar in the meeting tent in front of the veil. He burnt sweet smelling incense on it just as the Lord had commanded Moses. He also set up the screen at the entrance to the dwelling. He placed the entire burned offerings at the entrance to the meeting tent dwelling." - Exodus 40:25-29a CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									HOF COT will be built to God’s specifications and not to any man’s ideas. The glory of God will fill the church perpetually as we continue to follow His instructions in building his church in the area of size, seating arrangements, equipment etc.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									The Holy Spirt uses the word of God to wash people’s lives. HOF COT will preach the undiluted word of God (Truth, Holiness, and Spirituality) and these will be used constantly in season and out of season. The messages from the church will cause revival in this nation as it will be the word that will cause light in issues affecting people in the community.
								</p>

										"The shovel he uses to sift the wheat from the husks is in his hands. He will clean out his threshing area and bring the wheat into his barn. But he will burn the husks with a fire that can’t be put out." - Matthew 3:12 CEB
									</i>
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									Pastor Philomena will have the grace of God to preach the Truth and in Spirit that will cause revival to break out in this nation. She will preach the Word without fear or favour, her integrity will cause God to back her words with His signs and His wonders, because of her diligence, she will stand before kings and not mean men.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									God wants us to shine as the stars and even like super stars in our lifestyles, gifting, our careers and our call to righteousness. We need to release the potentials of God in our lives. We should not remain stagnant and can progress by staying away from sin.
								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									<i>
										"The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day." - Proverbs 4:18 CEB

								</p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									My Lord and father, as you have called us to ministry, help us to forsake any sin (disobedience, stealing, corruption, laziness towards your work, being ungrateful in the things you have blessed us with, committing murder in our actions, lying and living a pretentious life). Father forgive me, so that my light will shine brighter and brighter.
								</p>
								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									Everyone in HOF COT will be the salt of the earth that will not lose its taste. Every member will be used as a preservative for people that God will bring to the church, they will be living the truth, they will be taste enhancers who will enhance people positively, they will be as antiseptic and cleansing ingredient including for medicinal purposes and for healing the wounded through the word.

									Father, let any member of my church not lose their taste, let us live a God fearing life, pour your Spirit upon us as a people, let us not be like salt that loses its taste and is  thrown away.

									The Bible admonishes us according to ‭‭1 Timothy‬ ‭2:1-3‬, <i>“Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,”</i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Let us pray for a willingness to intercede on behalf of our nation. Pray we will not become tired or discouraged. Pray we will not just intercede during times of trouble but we will continuously lift up our Prime Minister and government leaders. This nation is depending on us, let us pray. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									The Lord is the one who plants us strategically at our work places. We are expected to pray for our managers. The bible says in Luke‬ ‭12:37‬, <i>“Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching. Assuredly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them.”</i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Let us pray that we will be faithful in our work. Pray also that our workplace managers will have a heart of a servant and not take advantage of their workers. Pray also for peace and good relationship in our workplace. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									The Lord has also placed our children in educational institutions which are aligned to their purpose and destiny. God has placed helpers of destiny at their schools and universities. The Lord has promised in Isaiah‬ ‭54:13‬, <i>“All your children shall be taught by the LORD, And great shall be the peace of your children.”</i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Pray that our children will align with their pre ordained helpers of destiny at their schools and universities. Pray that they will be anointed with the spirit of excellence. Pray they will be favoured by their teachers and will excel in all they put their hands to do. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									The Lord has entrusted a special assignment into the hands of our Pastors and provided leaders to help carry the load. In Hebrews‬ ‭13:5-6‬ The Lord admonishes us to <i>“Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' So we may boldly say: 'The LORD is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?'”</i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Pray that the leadership of HOF will never become covetous. Pray we will operate with contentment. Pray we will not depend on our own ability but we will depend on the help which comes from the Lord. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									As we see our nation riddled with crime and drugs, we need our judicial system to work in unity and uphold the rule of law. Wisdom is needed for our judges and criminal justice systems to keep us safe. James‬ ‭1:5‬ ‬‬says <i>“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.”</i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Pray for our judges, lawyers, magistrates, protective services- police, fireman, army, navy etc. that God will bless and guide the heads of these departments to lead with wisdom. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									At this period of uncertainty given the brexit decision, let us continue to pray for our parliament to be led by the spirit of God. Making decisions in the country’s interest and not for any personal gains. Pray that God’s will be done in this nation. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									As the Lord placed man to be the head of the family, we want all men to take up their priestly and kingly role with pride and responsibility. 1 Corinthians‬ ‭11:3‬ says <i>“But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.” </i> 
								</p>
								<p class="leadBlog">
									Pray for every husband and father to take up his rightful place. Pray for peace and unity in families that children will have good role models of fathers who are men of prayer and integrity. 
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<p class="leadBlog">
									Finally, the Lord will go before us into 2019. Let us commit every day of the month of April 2019 into the hands of the Lord. Pray that every day of the year will be covered with God’s divine protection. Pray we will be anointed to make a difference every day of April 2019 and beyond.

										"It is good to give thanks to the Lord, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High. To declare Your lovingkindness in the morning, and Your faithfulness every night, on an instrument of ten strings, on the lute, and on the harp, with harmonious sound. For You, Lord, have made me glad through Your work; I will triumph in the works of Your hands. O Lord, how great are Your works! Your thoughts are very deep. A senseless man does not know, nor does a fool understand this. When the wicked spring up like grass, and when all the workers of iniquity flourish, it is that they may be destroyed forever. But You, Lord, are on high forevermore." <br/>
										- Psalms 92:1-8

										"Oh come, let us sing to the Lord! Let us shout joyfully to the Rock of our salvation. Let us come before His presence with thanksgiving; let us shout joyfully to Him with psalms. For the Lord is the great God, and the great King above all gods. In His hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the hills are His also. The sea is His, for He made it; and His hands formed the dry land. Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand. Today, if you will hear His voice:" <br/>
										- Psalms 95:1-7

										"Make a joyful shout to the Lord, all you lands! Serve the Lord with gladness; come before His presence with singing. Know that the Lord, He is God; it is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; we are His people and the sheep of His pasture. Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, and into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, and bless His name. For the Lord is good; His mercy is everlasting, and His truth endures to all generations." <br/>
