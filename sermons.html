		                    <h3>"Leave The Past" - Sunday 10th February 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Matthew 25:14-29<br/>
		                    	Isaiah 60:1
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Don’t allow your fear from the past rob you of your future. Just because it didn't work last time doesn't mean it won't work ever again.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God will never give us more than we can handle, it is all about the time and the season. When He knows we are ready to handle more, without the increased load stunting our growth, He will give us more.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	The Father has given gifts/talents to every single one of us. The more we use them, the more they grow and in turn He increases that which we already have. If we do not nurture our talents and put them to good use we become like the servant who buried his for fear of failure, producing nothing new and resulting in the talent which had already been given being taken away.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away." <br/>
		                    	- Matthew 25:29
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Never sell your talents short, if you see anything that you can add to and make better, do it. Don’t wait for someone more qualified to come along  just use what you already have with faith and God will add to it.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Father, we thank You for every gift/talent that You have put inside of us. Help us to put them to work for You, give us the courage and boldness to put ourselves out there in faith. Help us to trust that what You have put inside of us is enough to complete the challenges we face and where it isn't we know that You will meet us at our need, giving us what we require to finish strong. <br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <h3>"What If God Says No?" - Sunday 3rd February 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	2 Samuel 12<br/>
		                    	Daniel 3<br/>
		                    	Jonah 3:5-10
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	How do we respond when God says no to the very thing we have been praying for? If the things we desire will derail us from His purpose for our lives then it is in our best interest for God to say no.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God wants us to get to a place where our joy is not shaken by a yes or a no. A place where we have learnt to trust His perfect plan so much so that we know every door He closes will redirect us to something far better.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Whenever God says no it is for reasons bigger than just us, His response is always rooted in His love for us. Failing to accept God’s no can cause us to run into bad situations where we will have to call on Him to help get us out of something we should have never been near in the first place.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, 'O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.'"<br/>
		                    	- Matthew 26:39
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	The final say belongs to the Father, there are no amount of works nor levels of righteousness we can try to attain to twist His arm. His original purpose will always be at the heart of His response. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <h3>"God Wants It All" - Sunday 20th January 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Genesis 13:1-9 & 14-18 <br/>
		                    	Acts 17:30-31 <br/>
		                    	Romans 2:1a
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	When we first start our journey with the Lord a lot of us will still be holding on to baggage from our previous life. At first God will allow this but as we walk with Him there will come a time when He'll take us to a place our baggage cannot enter.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Baggage can range from toxic relationships/friendships to "little" vices that we've deemed insignificant enough to ignore. The deeper we go with God the higher the level of righteousness we must walk in and as a result everything taking space in our hearts other than The Father must be pushed out. He wants to be the only one sitting on the throne of our hearts.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God wants to deliver us from our baggage and even though He won't force us, a lot of the time it is what is keeping us from moving to the next level. Him allowing us to hold on to our baggage is not permitting it, He's giving us time to repent and let go of our own free will. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?" <br/>
		                    	- Romans 2:4
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	When we fall we must be quick to check ourselves and get right with God. We must avoid being fooled by the false sense of security that comes with sinning behind closed doors and getting away with it in the faces of our peers. God sees everything. No matter how well we pretend to be righteous, God sees us.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Lord, thank You for Your love and faithfulness. Thank You because even though You see us at our worst You still love us. Please bless us with the boldness and courage to let go of everything that is keeping us from from holding on to You. No matter how hard or painful it is we are choosing You and only You. Keep us pure and in a state of humility so that when we fall we will run right back to You. <br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>
