		                    <p>
		                        Psalm 34:1-5 <br/>
		                        2 Corinthians 10:3-5
							</p>

							<p>
								There is always reason to bless the Lord. When we fall into times of hardship it is easy to forget that it is only by His grace that we are alive to have problems to complain about and by His mercy that we have experienced better to know that our current situation is worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Don't just get through your tough seasons, embrace and enjoy them! Find a word from God that you can hold on to and use as motivation to remain in a place of peace, turning every trial into a lesson that'll equip you with wisdom to tackle the next season. 
							</p>

							<p>
								"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing." <br/>
								- James 1:2-4
							</p>

							<p>
								Comparison is the thief of joy, therefore, coveting the realities of others will trap us in a constant state of misery. Instead, we must learn to see the beauty in our own realities and let our joy flow from the inside out, protecting our faith (internal) from the attacks of our woes (external).
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord, teach us to give thanks at all times. Thank You for the life You have given to us and forgive us for every blessing we have overlooked. We don't want to just put on a brave face and pretend to enjoy the season, show us the beauty in every heartbreak, the lesson in every failure and the strength in every fall. <br/>
								Amen.
							</p>

							<p>Happy New Year!</p>

		                    <h3>"The Power of His Word" - Sunday 23th December 2018</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	John 11:1-45<br/>
		                    	Matthew 8:5-13<br/>
		                    	Psalm 107:20
							</p>
							<p>
								It's easy to forget the power that God has given to us through His Word. However, the moment we recognise the same power that raised Jesus from the dead has been given to us our entire approach to trials and tribulations will change.
							</p>

							<p>
								"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."<br/>
								- Romans 8:11
							</p>

							<p>
								There may be times where we feels our cries are going unheard but God hears everything. He may allow our situation to die to the point other people are talking about the stench, but when He restores and rejuvenates us those same people will serve as witnesses to His mighty power.
							</p>

							<p>
								If people don't know how dead you once were they won't be able to appreciate the life you have now. Therefore, it is very important that we showcase our challenges no matter how long we have been facing them. God does not need us to protect or defend His image, so there is no point in hiding our existing struggles because we think God is taking "too long" to help us. Our faith must be public and bold at all times as we don't know who else's faith is depending on it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Father, help us to understand the power You have given to us. Strengthen our faith. When we doubt You, help our unbelief. Keep us in Your Word so that we will constantly be reminded of Your promises. Let our struggles serve as examples of Your awesome power.<br/>
								Amen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Merry Christmas!

		                    <p>
		                        Luke 14:16-27<br/>
		                        Matthew 19:21-22
							</p>

							<p>
								It is critical that we learn to carry our cross while we serve as service without a cross is just convenient worship. Therefore, regardless of what is happening in our lives, these things must become secondary to Christ.
							</p>

							<p>
								Making excuses for why we are "unable" to serve will only derail and distract from the full potential God has made available. A lot of the time we are willing to serve up until a point but God requires all of us. He requires everything! Until we learn what it is to sacrifice we will never understand what Jesus did for us.
							</p>

							<p>
								It's easy to follow when you have nothing which is why Jesus says we need to be willing to let go of all that we have before we can be His disciples. Everything we need is in His hand therefore the best place to be is with Him. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord, grant us wisdom and understanding that we may know what true sacrifice is. Open our eyes to every way in which we are robbing ourselves of fully experiencing You by making excuses. Thank You  because You have already perfected our path, help us to trust and walk with You. <br/>
								Amen.
							</p>

							<p>Have a blessed week!</p>
