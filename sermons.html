	                    <p>
	                        Luke 14:16-27<br/>
	                        Matthew 19:21-22
						</p>

						<p>
							It is critical that we learn to carry our cross while we serve as service without a cross is just convenient worship. Therefore, regardless of what is happening in our lives, these things must become secondary to Christ. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Making excuses for why we are "unable" to serve will only derail and distract from the full potential God has made available. A lot of the time we are willing to serve up until a point but God requires all of us. He requires everything! Until we learn what it is to sacrifice we will never understand what Jesus did for us.
						</p>

						<p>
							It's easy to follow when you have nothing which is why Jesus says we need to be willing to let go of all that we have before we can be His disciples. Everything we need is in His hand therefore the best place to be is with Him. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Lord, grant us wisdom and understanding that we may know what true sacrifice is. Open our eyes to every way in which we are robbing ourselves of fully experiencing You by making excuses. Thank You  because You have already perfected our path, help us to trust and walk with You. 
							<br/>
							Amen.
						</p>

						<p>Have a blessed week!</p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Luke 15:10-32<br/>
		                    	2 Peter 3:8-9
							</p>
							<p>
								God is much more enjoyable when we learn to wait on Him. It's easy to get so wrapped up in the one thing He hasn't done that we forget about the countless others He has done. When we learn to trust His timing we are able to appreciate and embrace that which we currently have.
							</p>

							<p>
								"For the vision is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it will speak, and it will not lie. Though it tarries, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry." <br/>
								- Habakkuk 2:3
							</p>

							<p>
								God is never late and His timing is always perfect. Being in a hurry can result in us arriving too early only to find God hasnâ€™t arrived yet or arriving too late, having wasted time going down the wrong path, only to find God has already left.
							</p>

							<p>
								Successful completion of our purpose requires us to be ourselves therefore following the crowd is dangerous. When we try to fit the mould made for someone else our own assignment is neglected.
							</p>

							<p>
							Lord, help us to be like the wise man who learns from the mistakes of others. Give us the grace to see and appreciate all that You have put inside of us instead of coveting that which is outside. We want to walk with You at Your pace. Humble us so we don't run ahead and strengthen us that we don't lag behind. </br>
							Amen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Have a blessed week!

		                    <p>
		                        Matthew 6:33<br/>
		                        Acts 8:9-24<br/>
		                        Hebrews 4:12
							</p>

							<p>
								There is a problem when our needs are the only thing driving us towards The Father. God sees the heart so He is well aware of our motivation for calling on Him. In order to check our intent we must ask ourselves "Is this glorifying God or is it glorifying me?"
							</p>

							<p>
								The carnal man and the spirit man are similar to the on and off states of a light switch - the two cannot be active in unison. In order for the spirit to be alive the flesh must be put to death.
							</p>

							<p>
								At times God may hold off giving us what we ask for because He knows if we receive it during the wrong season it may be the very same thing that will drive us away from Him.
							</p>

							<p>
								"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning."</p><br>
								- James 1:17
							</p>

							<p>
								Every good and perfect gift comes from the Lord, so when He tells us to wait or let go of something, that He gave to us in the first place, we need to be able to do so knowing that gifts come and go but the only thing worth holding onto is the Giver.

							</p>

							<p>
								Lord, reveal every area where we are cherishing the gift more than we are cherishing You and free us from this bondage of the need to possess "things". We want to be so full in Your company that there is no space to desire anything else. Change our hearts God. Let our one and only desire be to dwell where You dwell.</br>
								Amen.
							</p>
