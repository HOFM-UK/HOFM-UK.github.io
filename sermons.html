		                    <p>
		                    	John 20:1-22
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	If hearsay is not even an acceptable evidence in court, why would we be satisfied basing our salvation on the words of others?! We need to seek our own personal encounters with the Lord instead of building our faith around the anecdotes of people. Only by pressing into the presence of the Lord will we be able to discover whether the tomb is empty or not.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first. And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; [...] Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed." <br/>
		                    	- John 20:4-6a, 8
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Do not wait for someone else to move before you move. Our pressing in could be what triggers our brothers and sisters to do the same. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	There is no such thing as coincidence with God's children. Wherever we are we must make sure to be a beacon of light because God has planted us there for such a time as this. We must take EVERY assignment seriously no matter how small it is in our eyes.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God is the best employer of labour therefore the fact He has called you means you are the best person for the job.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Lord, teach us to press in. Set our hearts on fire with a desire to know You for ourselves, a desire that can only be quenched by You and Your presence. Open our eyes that we may never miss the revelation of who You truly are. Grace us with boldness and endurance that we may run after You, stopping at nothing until we find You.<br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week.

		                    <p>
		                        Psalm 34:1-5 <br/>
		                        2 Corinthians 10:3-5
							</p>

							<p>
								There is always reason to bless the Lord. When we fall into times of hardship it is easy to forget that it is only by His grace that we are alive to have problems to complain about and by His mercy that we have experienced better to know that our current situation is worse.
							</p>

							<p>
								Don't just get through your tough seasons, embrace and enjoy them! Find a word from God that you can hold on to and use as motivation to remain in a place of peace, turning every trial into a lesson that'll equip you with wisdom to tackle the next season. 
							</p>

							<p>
								"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing." <br/>
								- James 1:2-4
							</p>

							<p>
								Comparison is the thief of joy, therefore, coveting the realities of others will trap us in a constant state of misery. Instead, we must learn to see the beauty in our own realities and let our joy flow from the inside out, protecting our faith (internal) from the attacks of our woes (external).
							</p>

							<p>
								Lord, teach us to give thanks at all times. Thank You for the life You have given to us and forgive us for every blessing we have overlooked. We don't want to just put on a brave face and pretend to enjoy the season, show us the beauty in every heartbreak, the lesson in every failure and the strength in every fall. <br/>
								Amen.
							</p>

							<p>Happy New Year!</p>

		                    <h3>"The Power of His Word" - Sunday 23th December 2018</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	John 11:1-45<br/>
		                    	Matthew 8:5-13<br/>
		                    	Psalm 107:20
							</p>
							<p>
								It's easy to forget the power that God has given to us through His Word. However, the moment we recognise the same power that raised Jesus from the dead has been given to us our entire approach to trials and tribulations will change.
							</p>

							<p>
								"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."<br/>
								- Romans 8:11
							</p>

							<p>
								There may be times where we feels our cries are going unheard but God hears everything. He may allow our situation to die to the point other people are talking about the stench, but when He restores and rejuvenates us those same people will serve as witnesses to His mighty power.
							</p>

							<p>
								If people don't know how dead you once were they won't be able to appreciate the life you have now. Therefore, it is very important that we showcase our challenges no matter how long we have been facing them. God does not need us to protect or defend His image, so there is no point in hiding our existing struggles because we think God is taking "too long" to help us. Our faith must be public and bold at all times as we don't know who else's faith is depending on it.
							</p>

							<p>
								Father, help us to understand the power You have given to us. Strengthen our faith. When we doubt You, help our unbelief. Keep us in Your Word so that we will constantly be reminded of Your promises. Let our struggles serve as examples of Your awesome power.<br/>
								Amen.
							</p>

							<p>
								Merry Christmas!
