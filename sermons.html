		                    <h3>"Let God Be In Charge" - Sunday 17th February 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Luke 12:15-21
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	One of the best decisions we will ever make after accepting Jesus Christ is asking God to be the manager of our lives. When we plan our lives without God we set ourselves up for failure.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God will not bring us into something that we are not ready for. It's easy for us to over/underestimate our ability to handle certain situations but a true manager knows the abilities of each of his players and as such can make the best decisions regarding when to play them to ensure success.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"'For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,' says the Lord. 'For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts.'" <br/>
		                    	- Isaiah 55:8-9
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God sees the greater picture while we are limited by what is in front of us. Sometimes He'll pump the brakes when we want to go faster because He can see that if we continue on our current path we will run into trouble. Other times He'll push us to keep going when we want to stop because He knows our breakthrough is just around the corner. It is a matter of trusting that only He truly knows what is best.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"Never be too quick to close a door because you never know when you will have to come back in." <br/>
		                    	- Pastor Philomena Ikonagbon
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Lord, we welcome You in as the Manager of our lives. Help us as we surrender every plan we have made for ourselves to Your perfect will and trust that Your way is best. In every area we have strayed, guide us back to You. May we never be too quick to close a door You have opened and may we have the faith to wait on You when all hope is seemingly fading. <br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <h3>"Leave The Past" - Sunday 10th February 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Matthew 25:14-29<br/>
		                    	Isaiah 60:1
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Don’t allow your fear from the past rob you of your future. Just because it didn't work last time doesn't mean it won't work ever again.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God will never give us more than we can handle, it is all about the time and the season. When He knows we are ready to handle more, without the increased load stunting our growth, He will give us more.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	The Father has given gifts/talents to every single one of us. The more we use them, the more they grow and in turn He increases that which we already have. If we do not nurture our talents and put them to good use we become like the servant who buried his for fear of failure, producing nothing new and resulting in the talent which had already been given being taken away.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away." <br/>
		                    	- Matthew 25:29
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Never sell your talents short, if you see anything that you can add to and make better, do it. Don’t wait for someone more qualified to come along  just use what you already have with faith and God will add to it.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Father, we thank You for every gift/talent that You have put inside of us. Help us to put them to work for You, give us the courage and boldness to put ourselves out there in faith. Help us to trust that what You have put inside of us is enough to complete the challenges we face and where it isn't we know that You will meet us at our need, giving us what we require to finish strong. <br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <p>
		                    	2 Samuel 12<br/>
		                    	Daniel 3<br/>
		                    	Jonah 3:5-10
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	How do we respond when God says no to the very thing we have been praying for? If the things we desire will derail us from His purpose for our lives then it is in our best interest for God to say no.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God wants us to get to a place where our joy is not shaken by a yes or a no. A place where we have learnt to trust His perfect plan so much so that we know every door He closes will redirect us to something far better.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Whenever God says no it is for reasons bigger than just us, His response is always rooted in His love for us. Failing to accept God’s no can cause us to run into bad situations where we will have to call on Him to help get us out of something we should have never been near in the first place.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, 'O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.'"<br/>
		                    	- Matthew 26:39
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	The final say belongs to the Father, there are no amount of works nor levels of righteousness we can try to attain to twist His arm. His original purpose will always be at the heart of His response. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!
