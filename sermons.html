	                    <p>
	                    	Acts 10:34-35 <br/>
	                    	John 10:27 <br/>
	                    	James 1:5
						</p>
						<p>
							As believers we have access to the Word of God which is the best and most direct way to hear from Him. However, a lot of the time we think it's too simple, we want the fire and grand displays our brothers and sisters seem to be getting, often mistaking this desire for more as spiritual hunger when in actuality it is spiritual greed. We neglect the ways in which God speaks to us because we are too busy coveting the ways in which He speaks to our brothers and sisters.
						</p>

						<p>
							We have to realise that God is impartial, giving every believer equal access to Him. That being said, the amount of Him we receive is completely dependent on our level of commitment and how much time we take to hear from Him. When we are spiritually lazy, depending on others for our weekly dose of God, we are bound to be malnourished and susceptible to being led astray.
						</p>

						<p>
							"The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests rule by their own power; and My people love to have it so. But what will you do in the end?" <br/>
							- Jeremiah 5:31
						</p>

						<p>
							Our prayer this week is that we will reject every seed of spiritual laziness and greed. Instead we will be hungry, totally consuming what has been made available to us then going back to His Word for more. We will spend time with God, so that when He speaks to us we will know His voice and follow Him.
						</p>

						<p>
							Have a blessed week.

	                    <p>
	                        1 Corinthians 10:12-13 <br/>
	                        Matthew 4:1-11 <br/>
	                        1 Peter 5:9
						</p>

						<p>
							Temptation itself is not a sin, it becomes a sin when we yield to it. The Bible says to flee temptation while pride tells us to stay and fight. A wise man realises he doesn't have to fight every battle he is invited to and stays well away.
						</p>

						<p>
							None of us are above temptation, even Jesus was tempted by the devil, but our reaction is what sets us apart. Peter and Judas are two contrasting examples of how our reaction to a fall can either propel or diminish our destiny.
						</p>

						<p>
							We are extremely fortunate to serve a God who not only understands but is willing to forgive us when we fall, provided we humble ourselves and ask for mercy.
						</p>

						<p>
							"For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted." <br/>
							- Hebrews 2:18
						</p>
						<p>
							Our prayer is that we will not fall into the trap of the enemy by yielding to temptation. Instead we will stand firm in truth, trusting that God has already provided a way out.
						</p>
						<p>Have a blessed week!</p>

	                    <p>
	                    	Genesis 17:1 <br/>
	                    	John 6:26 <br/>
	                    	Habakkuk 3:17-18
						</p>
						<p>
							Can you honestly call yourself a friend of Christ? Is everything you know of Him based on what you have heard from others or is it based on your actual experiences with Him?
						</p>

						<p>
							In this era of social media, the term friend is often used in place of the term follower. Followers will turn on you as soon as you do something they don't like, once there is no longer anything for them to gain they will cut their ties. 
						</p>

						<p>
							To be a friend requires commitment, sacrifice and trust. Can you honestly say that you are committed to Christ? That you would sacrifice your very last for Him and trust in Him despite the odds?
						</p>

						<p>
							It is not enough to just accept God's friend request, we must put in work to establish a friendship with Him.
						</p>

						<p>
							"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you." <br/>
							- John 15:15
						</p>

						<p>
							Our prayer is that this week, regardless of where we currently stand in our walk, we will all take our relationship with the Father to another level. As we press deeper, His word will be written on our hearts and we will be called friends of Christ and children of the Most High.
						</p>

						<p>
							Have a blessed week.
