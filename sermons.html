		                    <h3>"God Wants It All" - Sunday 20th January 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Genesis 13:1-9 & 14-18 <br/>
		                    	Acts 17:30-31 <br/>
		                    	Romans 2:1a
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	When we first start our journey with the Lord a lot of us will still be holding on to baggage from our previous life. At first God will allow this but as we walk with Him there will come a time when He'll take us to a place our baggage cannot enter.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Baggage can range from toxic relationships/friendships to "little" vices that we've deemed insignificant enough to ignore. The deeper we go with God the higher the level of righteousness we must walk in and as a result everything taking space in our hearts other than The Father must be pushed out. He wants to be the only one sitting on the throne of our hearts.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God wants to deliver us from our baggage and even though He won't force us, a lot of the time it is what is keeping us from moving to the next level. Him allowing us to hold on to our baggage is not permitting it, He's giving us time to repent and let go of our own free will. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and long-suffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance?" <br/>
		                    	- Romans 2:4
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	When we fall we must be quick to check ourselves and get right with God. We must avoid being fooled by the false sense of security that comes with sinning behind closed doors and getting away with it in the faces of our peers. God sees everything. No matter how well we pretend to be righteous, God sees us.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Lord, thank You for Your love and faithfulness. Thank You because even though You see us at our worst You still love us. Please bless us with the boldness and courage to let go of everything that is keeping us from from holding on to You. No matter how hard or painful it is we are choosing You and only You. Keep us pure and in a state of humility so that when we fall we will run right back to You. <br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <h3>"Reintroducing the King of Kings" - Sunday 13th January 2019</h3>
		                    <p>
		                    	Luke 1:6 <br/>
		                    	Luke 7:28 <br/>
		                    	Ecclesiastes 11:5-6
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God is the Beginning and the End. He is omnipresent, there with us though all parts of the journey and as such He chooses when it is best to meet with us. He is the Alpha and the Omega, we cannot pick and choose which parts of Him we want, He is everything. We either reverence Him in His fullness or miss out on His awesome presence.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: 'I am the First and I am the Last; besides Me there is no God.'" <br/>
		                    	- Isaiah 44:6
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Elizabeth spent many years praying for a child to seemingly no avail but, even in her old age when it looked as though all hope was lost, she still remained righteous and blameless before the Lord. <br/>
		                    	It's easy to get disheartened and act out when our prayers aren't answered right away and a lot of the time this stems from the false belief that we don't deserve to suffer just because we are Christians. However, we need to realise that no matter how long it takes, God is still God and His timing is perfect, even when the odds are stacked against us He is able to turn every dead and worn out situation around for His glory.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God has a time and a season for all of us. The contrasting stories of Elizabeth (old/barren) and Mary (young/virgin) leading to the timely births of John the Baptist and Jesus show that God's perfect plan is always in action. He will bring His promises to fruition regardless of the condition of our bodies, all He needs is a willing and faithful vessel.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	The experience of the old is always needed in the new. We must remain humble and willing to learn no matter how long our list of accomplishments. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Do not get complacent thinking the service in your early years is enough to carry you in your latter years. There is no transfer of service, we must remain as faithful in our old age as we were in our youth.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week!

		                    <p>
		                    	John 20:1-22
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	If hearsay is not even an acceptable evidence in court, why would we be satisfied basing our salvation on the words of others?! We need to seek our own personal encounters with the Lord instead of building our faith around the anecdotes of people. Only by pressing into the presence of the Lord will we be able to discover whether the tomb is empty or not.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	"So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first. And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen cloths lying there; yet he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; [...] Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed." <br/>
		                    	- John 20:4-6a, 8
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Do not wait for someone else to move before you move. Our pressing in could be what triggers our brothers and sisters to do the same. 
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	There is no such thing as coincidence with God's children. Wherever we are we must make sure to be a beacon of light because God has planted us there for such a time as this. We must take EVERY assignment seriously no matter how small it is in our eyes.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	God is the best employer of labour therefore the fact He has called you means you are the best person for the job.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Lord, teach us to press in. Set our hearts on fire with a desire to know You for ourselves, a desire that can only be quenched by You and Your presence. Open our eyes that we may never miss the revelation of who You truly are. Grace us with boldness and endurance that we may run after You, stopping at nothing until we find You.<br/>
		                    	Amen.
		                    </p>

		                    <p>
		                    	Have a blessed week.
