	                    <p>
	                    	Genesis 17:1 <br/>
	                    	John 6:26 <br/>
	                    	Habakkuk 3:17-18
						</p>
						<p>
							Can you honestly call yourself a friend of Christ? Is everything you know of Him based on what you have heard from others or is it based on your actual experiences with Him?
						</p>

						<p>
							In this era of social media, the term friend is often used in place of the term follower. Followers will turn on you as soon as you do something they don't like, once there is no longer anything for them to gain they will cut their ties. 
						</p>

						<p>
							To be a friend requires commitment, sacrifice and trust. Can you honestly say that you are committed to Christ? That you would sacrifice your very last for Him and trust in Him despite the odds?
						</p>

						<p>
							It is not enough to just accept God's friend request, we must put in work to establish a friendship with Him.
						</p>

						<p>
							"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you." <br/>
							- John 15:15
						</p>

						<p>
							Our prayer is that this week, regardless of where we currently stand in our walk, we will all take our relationship with the Father to another level. As we press deeper, His word will be written on our hearts and we will be called friends of Christ and children of the Most High.
						</p>

						<p>
							Have a blessed week.
						</p>

	                    <p>
	                        Isaiah 61:3-4<br/>
							Genesis 37-50<br/>
							1 Thessalonians 5:18
						</p>

						<p>
							God does not waste anything. No matter how far gone you think you are, or how dead your situation seems, He can still use it to complete beautiful works but only if you let Him. Be it a job, marriage or friendship, He is able to revive that which is long dead so let Him.
						</p>

						<p>
							When the enemy comes to steal your joy, keep dancing. If need be God will change the tune to make it easier but never stop giving thanks.
						</p>

						<p>
							"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing." <br/>
							- James 1:2-4
						</p>
						<p>
							Our prayer is that God will give us all the strength to keep an attitude of praise through our difficult moments. Knowing that as long as we are able to make it through, God will use the experience to catapult us into something greater.
						</p>
						<p>Have a blessed week!</p>

	                    	John 14:6-7<br/>
							Acts 4:32-35<br/>
							Acts 5: 1-11
						</p>
						<p>
							You can call on any name, Freedom, Mercy, Peace etc but it is only the name of Jesus Christ that saves. He is the Way, the Truth and Life.
						</p>
						<p>
							The prodigal son: How far can God run after you trying to bring you back to where you should be? He can only prompt you but can't drag you.
						</p>
						<p>
							The way the apostles lived in unity and Ananais and Sapphira's greed.There are areas in our lives that ONLY the Father sees and knows.
